\noindent \todo{IMPORTANT NOTE:} 

This file should contain the abstract of your thesis/report. It is expected that is
not more than 1-page in length.

When submitting your thesis to the ``Examination Schools'' of the University
of Oxford on High Street to schedule your viva examination, you are typically required
to submit two printed copies of your thesis (soft-bound) and, additionally, two
separate one-page printed copies of your abstract. 

This LaTeX template contains two versions of the abstract: The first version
(the page before the thesis title) contains your name, college affiliation and
is NOT meant to be part of the binding of your thesis. If you are not writing
a thesis for the University of Oxford, you can safely discard this page. 

The second version of the abstract (with the heading ``Abstract'' following
the ``Acknowledgements'' page), is meant to be part of your thesis document.

$4^{th}$ year projects do not need a separate abstract page as part of the final
report document.
