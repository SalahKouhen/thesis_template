\todo{Important note:} 

When submitting your DPhil thesis to the Submissions Desk at the Examination
Schools on High Street, you are typically required to submit two printed copies
of the thesis (soft-bound) and two separate printed copies of your abstract
that is no more one page. 

This LaTeX template contains two versions of the abstract. The 
first version (the page after the thesis title that contains your name, college 
affiliation and other information) is NOT meant to be part of the binding
of your thesis. If you are not writing a thesis for the University of Oxford, 
you can safely discard this page. The second version (with the heading 
``Abstract'' after the ``Acknowledgements'' page) is meant to be part of your
thesis document.

$4^{th}$ year projects do not need a separate abstract page as part of the final
report document.
