\begin{itemize}

\item{This thesis is concerned with examining the power spectra of the Earth's amtmosphere from a local perspective}

\item{This raises new possibilities... I find it logical to review the history of the topic as some discarded ideas may find new relevance}

\item{Next I present in some detail the new method that has made this investigation possible. I include a simplified explanation of why the Helmholtz decomp...}

\item{Then I present the local spectra of the atmopshere as we have so far uncovered them. I introduce conditioned spectra and maps of spectral slope}

\item{I then explore further applications of this methodology including several speculative directions for research}

\item{I conclude with a summary of my findings}
